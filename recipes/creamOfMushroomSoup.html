    <p>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For 6 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>16 ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li>
        <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>
        <li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
